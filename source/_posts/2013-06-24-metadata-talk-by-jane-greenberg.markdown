### Research Data and the Scholarly Communication Workflow


Last week at Bobst several of us got to hear a presentation by Prof. Jane Greenberg, director of UNC Chapel Hill's [Metadata Research Center](http://ils.unc.edu/mrc/), on "Research Data and the Scholarly Communication Workflow". Jane described her work as co-PI for the [Dryad.org](http://datadryad.org/) project, which, sitting on top of a hosted DSpace instance, enables authors to submit article drafts for publication together with associated research data,  have a [DOI](http://www.doi.org/) minted at the point of submission, and then have that same DOI embedded in the final published article. What this means is that others reading the article post-publication can  follow the DOI link to obtain the research data for themselves, replicate the author's experiment or combine findings with other data as part of a [meta-analysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis), and in general support reusability of data to the maximum benefit of the scientific community.

Since funding agencies like the NSF now require a data retention plan as a standard part of grant proposals, this is a smart way to make data sets easily findable and accessible through persistent embedded URIs. 

I'm interested in Dryad's ability to uniquely identify a set of data on the web, describe its contents accurately, and support re-use and exchange in unexpected and interesting ways. I'm also interested in the way Dryad works with [HIVE](https://code.google.com/p/hive-mrc/) (Helping Interdisciplinary Vocabulary Engineering), another project co-led by Jane, which allows authors to submit documents for natural language processing and entity extraction and then matches entities to controlled vocabulary terms that can be assigned as part of the Dryad data submission packet.

The Sloan Foundation is [currently providing grants](http://orcid.org/blog/2013/06/13/orcid-awarded-grant-alfred-p-sloan-foundation-support-university-and-professional) to encourage wider usage of the ORCID standard, and I was pleased to hear that [ORCID](https://orcid.org/content/rfp-2013-06-orcid-id-adoption-and-integration-program) numbers are now being integrated with DRYAD. In the same way that DOIs provide an unambiguous and persistent identifier for data sets, ORCID provides a persistent unique identifier for the researchers who create and use them. Jane encourages  libraries to get involved with ORCID but also notes the risk of duplicating efforts with  projects like the Virtual International Authority File ([VIAF](http://viaf.org/viaf/45531039/#Greenberg,_Jane))
  

Some other items Jane mentioned I'd like to follow up on: Preservation (e.g., the most common Dryad format is the Excel spreadsheet, which is not a preservation format); version control (currently managed through DSpace, but needs improvement); linked data (Jane suggested  researchers might submit their data as native RDF to support this); relationships to [DataOne](http://www.dataone.org/what-dataone), Thomson Reuters [Data Citation Index](http://wokinfo.com/products_tools/multidisciplinary/dci/) and Jim Gray's [Fourth Paradigm](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/collaboration/fourthparadigm/)
