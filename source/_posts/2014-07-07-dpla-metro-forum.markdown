Last week I attended a [forum]( http://metro.org/events/521/) at the [Metropolitan New York Library Council](http://metro.org/) (METRO) on the Digital Public Library of America (DPLA) and the [Empire State Digital Network](http://www.ny3rs.org/empire-state-digital-network/) (ESDN). There were four speakers, 2 representing the New York Public Library (which is a DPLA content hub -- more on that below), 1 representing DPLA, and 1 representing ESDN. 

The first speaker was Matt Miller, Application Developer at NYPL Digital Library and Labs. He touched on digital library infrastructure and workflows at NYPL, including metadata remediation, linked data publishing, API development, and an upcoming implementation of [ArchiveSpace](http://www.archivesspace.org/).  

Josh Hadro, Deputy Director of  NYPL Digital Library and Labs, was up next .  He discussed the relationship between NYPL and DPLA, e.g., that, as a content hub, virtually all of NYPL's digital collections (including 802,000 digital objects thus far) have been submitted to DPLA, which in turn has  become a primary driver of traffic back to NYPL collections. While NYPL ranks high in terms of the number of its collections represented in DPLA, it is less prominent in terms of DPLA page views.  Reviewing analytics, Josh suggested that metadata may be responsible (e.g., non-existent or incorrect access points that can skew DPLA's search engine results).

Mark Matienzo, DPLA Director of Technology, was the third speaker. He provided background on DPLA, its origins in 2010 at Harvard's [Berkman Center for Internet & Society](http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/), its transition in 2013 to an operational 501(c)(3). He explained that DPLA can be thought of as three things: a discovery portal, a software platform, and as an "[advocate for a strong public option](http://dp.la/info/)".  As a portal, DPLA aggregates multiple collections and displays results through various interfaces and visualizations. There's a traditional results list, a [Timeline](http://dp.la/timeline), a [Bookshelf](http://dp.la/bookshelf), a [Map](http://dp.la/map), and an [Exhibitions](http://dp.la/exhibitions) interface. As a platform, DPLA provides an [API](http://dp.la/info/developers/codex/) and an [Apps Library](http://dp.la/apps). And as "an advocate for a strong public option", DPLA extends the reach and mission of public libraries through enhanced access to digital information and by promoting an informed citizenry.

Mark discussed the role of [content hubs](http://dp.la/info/hubs/#our-content-hubs), i.e., large, direct tributaries such as NYPL and HathiTrust, and the role of [service hubs](http://dp.la/info/hubs/#our-service-hubs), i.e., regional or consortial groups such as ESDN that aggregate and normalize members' metadata before repackaging and relaying them to DPLA. 

Kerri Willette was the fourth and final speaker and spoke about the Empire State Digital Network (ESDN), of which she is the manager. This is the regional service hub for New York State, based at METRO.  

During the Q&A period, there was some discussion about DPLA's relationship to Europeana. Mark pointed out that Europeana has EU governmental backing with 50-60 full time staff;  DPLA is more of a grass-roots effort with 10 full-time staff. DPLA was heavily influenced by Europeana, though, and the two are cooperating on a shared intellectual property rights ontology. The metadata applications profiles are quite similar, too. It didn't come up in the event, but I know they've cooperated on some [exhibits](http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/node/7159), e.g., one on [immigration from Europe to North America](http://dp.la/exhibitions/exhibits/show/leaving-europe). 

Another Q&A topic was about prerequisites to becoming a DPLA contributor. One important step is to map one's own metadata to the DPLA application profile, and ESDN will be providing documentation to help with this. Participants must also agree to share their metadata with a permissive license. Mark pointed out that in the short run, it can be deceptively simple to map schemas like [unqualified Dublin Core](http://dublincore.org/documents/dces/) to the DPLA application profile, but it actually causes greater challenges downstream because field values are more ambiguous and therefore require interpretation and disambiguation. More complex schemas are actually easier to accommodate in the long run.
