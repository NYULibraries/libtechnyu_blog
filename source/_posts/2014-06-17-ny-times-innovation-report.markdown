### Some Reflections on the Leaked New York Times Innovation Report

Libraries and newspapers have been going through a similar kind of crisis and transformation during the last few decades. Both types of organization are adapting to new information technology, new communication platforms, and new notions of authority, and both are re-assessing the way information and knowledge get distributed (and monetized). The old idea (however imperfect) of journalists or librarians as arbiters of information or gatekeepers of documented knowledge has been upended. So, even though I'm not in the news business, I read with interest a recently-leaked [internal report](http://www.scribd.com/doc/224332847/NYT-Innovation-Report-2014) from the New York Times about the need for more self-awareness and more strategic decision-making. And because much of the proposed solution involves information technology (including agile  development and semantic tagging), I thought the #libtechnu blog would be a good place to share some reflections.

What first caught my attention was a [May 15th post](http://www.niemanlab.org/2014/05/the-leaked-new-york-times-innovation-report-is-one-of-the-key-documents-of-this-media-age/) by Joshua Benton to the [Nieman Journalism blog](http://www.niemanlab.org/), where he wrote, "The leaked New York Times Innovation report is one of the key documents of this media age ... Abramson's removal and Dean Baquet's ascent has apparently inspired someone inside the Times to leak one of the most remarkable documents I've seen in my years running the Lab."

Having read the 96-page report, I agree that it's a remarkable document. 

The basic problem statement is that the Times continues lead the pack in  terms of the quality of its journalism, but is slipping in its ability to reach its target audience, exploit emerging technologies, and secure a sustainable business model. 

The report is divided into three chapters, or sets of recommendations: 

1. Growing our Audience
2. Newsroom Strategy Team
3. Digital First

The first chapter invokes the familiar 'innovator's dilemma', where incumbents (established players) innovate through incremental improvements while disruptive newcomers introduce  products that are initially cheaper and shoddier and therefore seemingly non-threatening, but eventually good enough to  leap-frog into the lead. 

Who are the disruptive innovators for the  Times? BuzzFeed and Huffington Post to name a few. These sites contain a lot of derivative or 'inferior' content, but are much better at engaging their audience, building community, and supporting two-way communication. (p. 24). But why should we care if the incumbent is displaced or even destroyed? In the case of the Times, perhaps because a lot of good journalism would not longer be available for repackaging and annotation in the blogosphere. The ecosystem as a whole would be impoverished.

Is there a similar threat to libraries, having lost their monopoly on access to information? Would people miss us if we disappeared from the scene? Or would disruptive innovators quickly fill the gaps? (I think people would miss us.)

There's a sidebar on "Best Practices in Experimentation" on page 31 (which sounds familiar to those of us working on the Ichabod project). Unlike a printed newspaper, "a digital experiment should be released quickly and refined through a a cycle of continuous improvement." Other recommended practices include A/B testing, after-action reviews, abandoning mediocre projects, planning for version 2.0, and "making it easier to launch an experiment than to block one" (p. 32). 

As a metadata-oriented librarian, the discussion of semantic tagging resonates with me. The report quotes John O'Donovan, chief technology officer for the The Financial Times, saying, "all of your assets are useless to you unless you have metadata -- your archive is full of stuff that is of no value because  you can't find it and don't know what it's about (p. 41). For example, 60% of readers access the Times through mobile phones, and yet articles lack geographic tags that could take advantage of the embedded GPS sensors. The report also notes, "it took seven years for us to start tagging stories 'September 11" after the event (p. 41). The Library may have similar gaps to consider as we rethink our strategy for tagging in BobCat, and more generally revise the we organize documents and data in our content management systems. 

The report describes a culture at the Times that enforces a "separation of church and state", i.e., a tendency to segregate journalists from business and technology experts. There's a legitimate need to keep journalists insulated from, say, marketing, the authors acknowledge, but it's possible to take this too far and alienate the people who know how to develop communication tools, platforms, and templates, from the writers and editors who need to use those tools.  

The second chapter makes the case for a "Newsroom Strategy" team to advise on  "competitors' strategies, changing technology, and shifting reader behavior." It should also keep track of projects around the company that bear on the Times' digital goals (p.71), perhaps send weekly updates to top management (p. 74), invite speakers, interview competitors, and help identify priorities (p. 80).   

The third chapter makes the case for the Times being a "Digital First" company, meaning that rapidy-changing digital content is treated as primary and the printed newspaper, derivative. Considering the ongoing pressure on reporters to get their stories onto the front page, and  performance evaluations still tied to print, this may be an example of what [DeEtta Jones](http://www.deettajones.com/) called "Culture eating strategy for lunch." Of course, strategy *can* change culture, which is exactly what this report is trying to do.
